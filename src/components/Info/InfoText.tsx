            <br /><br />
            &nbsp; Guess the letters in the secret word to solve the puzzle within a certain number of guesses (6). You can guess a letter by clicking it or typing it on your keyboard. If you guess a letter which occurs in the word, it appears in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, on screen adds one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark. The game ends once the word is guessed, or if the stick figure is complete â€” signifying that all guesses have been used.

            <br /><br />
            &nbsp; Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called 'Birds, Beasts, and Fishes'. This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player to fill in the blanks.
            <br /><br />
            &nbsp; A version which incorporated hanging imagery was described in a 1902 article in 'The Philadelphia Inquirer', which stated that it was popular at "White Cap" parties hosted by 'Vigilance Committees' where guests would wear "white peaked caps with masks".

            &nbsp; Originally a paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions.
